level 2 autonomous pycar
In the past decade, driverless cars have gone from 'impossible' to 'inevitable'. Google's self-driving car project started in 2009 and now most car manufacturers have adopted or are developing autonomous driving capabilities. The central concept behind the technology is to use trained object detection models to make principled decisions about what manoeuvres a car should make. In this project your task is to collect a data set of images and use them to train a machine learning algorithm to autonomously navigate around a realistic test circuit, and make the appropriate manoeuvres where necessary.

This Kaggle challenge consists of 13.8k images, along with the target car response (speed and
steering angle). It allows you to automate the process of
model submission, and obtain an indication of performance (using a small set
of test data) before we evaluate them on the final, unseen data. This score will contribute towards 10% of your final mark.
